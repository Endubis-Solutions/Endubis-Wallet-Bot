# Endubis Wallet Bot

A very simple Cardano wallet running as a telegram bot.

# Some disclaimers

Endubis Wallet is not created by Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, or IOHK. The official Cardano team has not reviewed this code and is not responsible for any damage it may cause you. Please be aware that if your device is compromised, your mnemonic may be leaked when used as the access method on Endubis Wallet. We appreciate feedback, especially a review of the crypto-related code.

## Why we are building this

Endubis wallet is created as a means to enable easy payments in ADA. Our target audience for this app/bot are people new to the crypto space, that don't want to deal with or have access to centralized platforms. We are strong believers in decentralized systems and thus our aim was to make the Cardano world easily accessible to the broader population. That is why we picked Telegram, the most widely used chatting app in Ethiopia, as a starting point. Since Endubis Wallet doesn't run a full node or require to sync the entire blockchain it's also very fast. Recovering your wallet from the mnemonic only takes a few seconds.
